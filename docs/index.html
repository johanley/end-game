<h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>
The main purpose of this project is: 
<ul> 
 <li>to help you explore different retirement scenarios  
 <li>to help you find a better financial plan for your retirement
</ul>

<P><b>This tool is focused almost entirely on the retirement phase of life (spending), not on the 
working phase of life (saving)</b>.

<P>The level of detail in this tool is higher than usual.
Whereas most tools focus on a high-level rate of return, this tool actually goes through every single day of your retirement, 
and applies transactions to your accounts.
It also calculates a basic tax return at the end of every year.

<P>The level of detail will not reflect your actual reality 100%, but it will get you closer to reality than most other tools.
It's a trade off: in a perfect world, matching reality 100% is of course desirable; but to implement all possible cases
for all possible conditions is not practical here. 
So this tool tries to reach a compromise, and <b>tries to reflect reality to a reasonable degree, but not with 100% accuracy</b>. 

<P>
Every retirement financial plan should be supported by a robust simulation showing you the numbers.
Personal finance is quite complex.
There are many moving parts, and how those parts all work together in your particular case can be found only with a simulator. 
<b>You can't do these calculations in your head, and you shouldn't rely entirely on <em>rules of thumb</em>, because such 
rules usually have exceptions.</b>

<P>This tool has:
<ul>
 <li>helped me find thousands of additional dollars in cash flow
 <li>increased my level of confidence in my financial plan
 <li>helped me answer many different questions
 <li>helped me in speaking to a financial advisor
</ul>

<h2 id='limitations'>Limitations</h2>
This tool has a limited scope:
<ul>
 <li>there's no spousal logic.
 <li>the set of supported securities is only cash, stocks, and GICs. 
 <li>it supports RSP/RIF, TFSA, non-registered accounts, and simple bank accounts, but no other types of accounts. 
 <li>there's no logic specific to insurance, debt, real estate, charitable donations, and so on.
</ul>

In spite of these limitations, you may find it useful to examine the example scenario outputs.

<P>There are <b>two important issues which I hope to address soon</b>:
<ul>
  <li>add support for ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds, an asset class that is very widely held)
  <li>add support for LIRA/LIF accounts
 </ul>

In general, I would like to improve the tool. I could use some assistance with that.

<h2 id='features'>Features</h2>
Features include:
<ul>
 <li>input-output using text files
 <li>the input text file is a <em>scenario</em>, a text file describing details of your accounts, assets, transactions, 
  start-date for retirement, expected CPP benefit, pension, and so on
 <li>internally, the system runs through every single day of your entire retirement life, and applies transactions defined 
 in your scenario file
 <li>some scenarios have randomness, and some don't 
 <li>the randomness only comes from variation in the market price of securities
 <li>basic tax returns are calculated, both federal and provincial (territories not included at present)
 <li>the output is in .csv (comma-separated) files, which are easily imported into spreadsheet tools
 such as Google Sheets or Open Office (and thereby charted)
 <li>log output shows transactions, yearly summaries, and tax returns
 <li>you can repeat a scenario multiple times, to reflect the spread in outcomes caused by randomness (Monte Carlo simulation)
 <li>the tool can run multiple scenarios in sequence 
 <li>the code is implemented in Java, and can be run on any computer
 <li>changes to the market prices of stock are applied once a year
</ul>

<P>Some items that aren't modeled explicitly can still be effectively modeled by the system. 
 For example, the sale of a primary residence can be modeled as a simple windfall deposited to your bank account, since 
 no tax is paid on the capital gain when you sell your home.  

<P>There are two distinct types of scenarios:
<ul> 
 <li>those with precisely predictable cash flows (OAS, CPP, GIS, annuities, pensions)
 <li>those without precisely predictable cash flows (assets vary in value with the market price)
</ul>

<P>Examples of approximations made by the tool:
<ul> 
 <li>stock prices are updated just once a year (using a policy you define) 
 <li>the tax return is calculated and applied simply at the end of the year, and not later in the following year
 <li>OAS clawbacks are applied (for high income earners) all in one year; in reality, the clawback is applied over 2 calendar years
 <li>the life-table stats from Statistics Canada are for the Canada-wide case, not for the specific province
</ul>

<h2 id='scenarios'>Example Scenarios</h2>
These example scenarios are included in the source code. 
They are listed in rough order of increasing complexity.

<P>Note that the <em>.ini</em> file is the scenario file, and the remaining files in the directory are outputs that 
result from executing the scenario. The provincial tax return is for PE, Prince Edward Island, simply because 
that's where the author resides. The tool allows for all other provinces as well.

<h2 id='lessons'>Lessons Learned</h2>

<b>Those with no savings will have cash flow in the low 20s.</b>
The cash flow for those who have no savings is basically the same no matter what your past history: it's in the low 20s.
This is because of how GIS works. GIS is designed to support cash flow up to a certain level, but not beyond that level.
Someone who has made 30K a year for their entire life, and has no savings, will have cash flow in the low 20s when 
they retire at 65, from OAS, GIS, and CPP. The same can be said if you made 100K a year, but spent it all and have no savings when 
you are 65. 

<P><b>It's the net cash flow that's most important.</b> That's where the focus should be. 
An example I saw had two scenarios, A vs B: A had 14k less tax than B, but only 2.9k more net cash than B.
If you leave out the net cash, and only focus on the tax saving, then you aren't fully informed.

<P><b>Spending generally decreases significantly in old age.</b>
Many people think in terms of having a flat cash flow, the same from retirement until death.
But, in reality, your spending usually decreases in old age. 
It's a challenge to generate a cash flow curve that starts out higher and ends up lower, 
because the natural tendency for cash flow is to grow over time.
For those on a government pension (and with no other savings), the cash flow is basically flat over time, 
so there may not be much you can do about it.

<P><b>Many people die too rich</b>.
The psychology of the saver is different from the psychology of the spender.
Some spend many years as a saver, and later fail to change into a spender.
They keep growing their net worth until the end.
That isn't necessarily the wrong thing to do, but for many it's likely not the best outcome.
Oversaving can be as bad as overspending; perhaps it's best to avoid extremes.

<P><b>Living only off of dividends is almost always an error.</b>
Some investors are enthusiastic about dividend stocks, and attempt to generate cash flow only from the dividends, 
without selling any of the principal invested in the stocks.
During retirement, there's no need to be so conservative.
Occasionally selling a small portion of your principal can generate a lot more cash flow, 
and is almost always better than relying solely on the dividends.   

<P><b>Selling stocks when the market is up, as opposed to when you want the cash, or according to a fixed schedule, is very beneficial.</b>
Given the large possible swings in stock prices, it makes sense to do <em>profit-taking</em> when the price is up.
You then save the cash for your future needs in 1-2 years (perhaps by purchasing a GIC).
You should avoid being compelled to sell stocks at a particular time.
The typical recession lasts about 1.5 years. 

<P><b>Desiring a sizeable legacy changes your plan significantly.</b> 
You have to understand what your goal is for your estate.
Some want to leave a significant legacy, and others want to spend as much as they can.
Both points of view are valid. 
But you have to know which is best for you, and act accordingly.

<P><b>Retirement planning is different from other projects, because it involves your own death.</b>
It's useful to be reminded that you might, by chance, die sooner rather than later.
The basic statistic from Statcan in this regard is interesting: the idea is that you start with a cohort of 
100,000 people at birth, and you then simply list the number of people that are still alive at each year of age.
The output spreadsheet files of this project usually incorporate this stat as a reminder of its importance.

 
<h2 id='running'>Running The Code In Eclipse</h2>

To run the code, this project recommends the <em>Eclipse</em> tool, a  
tool that programmers use to run and edit code. 
Here, you just want to run the code, not change it.

<P>Here are the <a href='gettingstarted/index.html'>detailed instructions</a>. It takes 10-15 minutes to set up.


<h2 id='syntax'>General Syntax</h2>
The scenario file has a specific syntax.
That is, the text in the scenario file has to <em>make sense</em> to the code.
You have to follow its rules, or an error will result, and the code will stop executing.
If you have a syntax error, then an error message will tell you the exact location (line number) in the scenario file.

<P><b>It's almost always best to start with an example scenario file that is closest to your situation. Then you gradually modify it, one piece at a time.</b>

<P>Note that:
<ul>
 <li>a leading # character means that following text is a comment
 <li>usually, the order of items in the file is fixed
 <li>an exception is the <em>transactions</em> block at the end. 
 Separate transactions in the <em>transactions</em> block can appear in any order.
</ul>

<P>

<h3 id='whencontrol'>The <em>on</em> statement</h3>

<P>There's a special <em>on</em> syntax for controlling when transactions are applied, and it occurs in various places.
Examples:

<pre>bank-debit-credit 925.00 on *-01</pre>
This means your bank is debited 925.00 on the first of every single month. 
 
<pre>on 2027-11-25</pre>
This means on that specific day, and no other.

<pre>on *-11-25</pre>
This means on every November 25th. 

<pre>on *-03-01,*-06-01,*-09-01,*-12-01</pre>
This means on every March 1, June 1, September 1, and December 1 (quarterly dividend payments, for example).

<pre>sell 6.0% on *-11-26 | 2027-01-01..2034-12-31</pre>
Executed every November 26, in the years 2027 to 2034. When the "|" appears, it adds start-date, end-date, or both.
There are 3 variations 
<pre>
sell 6.0% on *-11-26 | 2027-01-01..2034-12-31  # start-date and end-date
sell 6.0% on *-11-26 | 2027-01-01..            # only start-date
sell 6.0% on *-11-26 | ..2034-12-31            # only end-date</pre>
An exception to the above is the purchase of a GIC, which always uses a specific date.
In this case, the ":" character is used instead of the <em>on</em> statement:
<pre>buy-gic rif "Cda Trust" 5700.00 2.5% 1-year : 2024-06-21</pre>



<h2 id='examplesnippets'>Example Snippets</h2>
The following are examples of the various parts that can be found in a scenario file.
They appear here in the order that they are allowed to appear in the file.

<P>Some examples have various alternatives. 
One of the alternatives will be the active one, while the others are all <em>commented out</em> because the line starts with a '#' sign.
This lets you quickly change alternatives, by commenting out everything except the one you really want.

<P>Outside of the <em>transactions</em> block, items are usually required.
Any optional items are indicated as such below.

<P>Items in the <em>transactions</em> block are different:
<ul>
 <li>they can appear in any order
 <li>they are all optional
 <li>they can appear 0, 1, or N times in the <em>transactions</em>
</ul>

<p id='syntax-version'><pre>syntax-version = v1.0.0</pre>
States that this scenario file was created with a given version of the syntax for scenario files (which may change over time).
The idea is to ensure that code processing a scenario file knows the exact syntax of the file it's supposed to process.
The code is not smart enough to be backwards-compatible with "old" versions of the syntax.

<P id='description'><pre>description = "101.6: Fixed 3% growth in stock prices..."</pre>
A free-form, high-level description of important aspects of the scenario. 

<P id='number-of-iterations'><pre>number-of-iterations = 1</pre>
Usually 1. You change it to more than 1 when you want to repeat the scenario, from start to finish, multiple times.
This only makes sense if the various iterations have different results.
For example, when stock prices are generated using randomness, running multiple iterations makes logical sense, to see the general spread in the resulting outputs.
When greater than 1, the generated .csv files are completely different.

<P id='update-stock-prices'><pre>update-stock-prices {
  on *-11-25 # when stock prices are to be updated
  # gaussian mean = 5.0%  std-dev = 5.0% 
  # range = -5%_10%
  fixed = 3% # no randomness here
  # explicit-list = 5%,5%,5%,5%,5%,-7% # in order of year; recycles if end is reached
}</pre>
Optional. Controls how stock prices change over time.
In this example, the prices are updated only on November 25 of each year.
The <em>gaussian</em> style means that price increases follow a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution'>Gaussian distribution</a>.
The <em>range</em> example above means that the percentage price increase is randomly selected between -5% and +10%.

<P  id='simulation-start-date'><pre>simulation-start-date = 2022-01-01
simulation-end-date = 2042-12-31</pre>
The start and end dates for running the simulation. 
If multiple iterations are run, then each iteration starts with the start date.
Optionally, there can also be a test to see if the person has died at the end of the year.
If that is activated, then the simulation will often terminate before the end date is reached. 
(See below.)


<P  id='date-of-birth'><pre>date-of-birth = 1962-03-01
annual-test-for-survival
sex = male</pre>
The person's date of birth is used for various calculations.
The <em>annual-test-for-survival</em> is optional.
If <em>annual-test-for-survival</em> is included, then at the end of each simulated year, a statistical 
test is performed by the system, to see if the person will survive into the next year. 
If they fail to survive the test, then they die, and the simulation/iteration is terminated.
This feature uses <a href='https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/84-537-x/84-537-x2021001-eng.htm'>life-tables from Statistics Canada</a>, and those tables are different between males and females.  
 
<p id='year-zero-amounts'><pre>year-zero-amounts {

  net-income = 15180.00 # line 23600
  oas-income = 0.00
  employment-income = 0.00  
}</pre>
The simulation starts in the middle of life, and some items in the tax return need to refer to the previous year.
For the first year in the simulation, there is no data for the previous year, so this data fills that gap. 

<P id='oas'><pre>oas {
  monthly-amount-at-65 = 648.67 # as of 2022-06

  start-window-end = 70

}</pre>
The data used to calculate the OAS (Old Age Security) benefit.
The <em>start-month</em> is especially important.

<P id='cpp'><pre>cpp { 
  # can be used for QPP as well, since they have nearly the same core logic
  nominal-monthly-amount = 857.00 # if you start at age 65

  payment-day = 28   # not more than 28, otherwise you'll have no payment in most months of February!
  # payments are actually first received on the month AFTER the start-month
  monthly-reward = 0.7%   # for every month cpp is delayed past age 65
  monthly-penalty = 0.6%  # for every month cpp is started before age 65
  start-window-begin = 60 
  start-nominal = 65
  start-window-end = 70
}</pre>
The data used to calculate your CPP benefit.
The <em>nominal-monthly-amount</em> and the <em>start-month</em> are especially important.

<P id='rif-minimum-withdrawals'><pre>rif-minimum-withdrawals {

 72 = 5.40%
 ...elided for brevity...
 93 = 16.34%
 94 = 18.79%

Optional. RIF accounts always have a minimum annual withdrawal.
For some ages, a formula applies; for others, this table is used.

An example of a provincial tax return (for PEI).
The numbers have to be reviewed each year. 
See the <a href='https://github.com/johanley/end-game/tree/master/input/provincial-tax'>input\provincial-tax</a> directory for snippets appropriate to each province.

<P id='stocks'><pre>stocks {
  # Initial data on stocks; not related to an account.
  # All stocks must be defined here, even those you don't initially own.
  "ABC" {   
    price = 56.00
    dividend {
      on *-03-01,*-06-01,*-09-01,*-12-01
      amount = 0.86
      growth = 4.0%
    }
  }

     amount = 1.61
     growth = 4.0%
    }
  }
}</pre>
Optional. Data for all stocks that will be part of the simulation.
The ticker symbol is used to identify the stock.
The annual growth in the dividend is always modeled here simply as a fixed percentage.
In the above examples, the dividends pay quarterly, on the given month-day combinations.

<p id='stock-commission'><pre>stock-commission = fixed-percent 1.0%     # percent of the gross amount 
# stock-commission = fixed-amount 10.50   # some discount brokers have a flat rate
# stock-commission = custom-schedule      # requires custom coding</pre>
Optional. How to calculate the commission paid to your investment dealer when trading stocks.
The <em>custom-schedule</em> is to let you reflect you investment dealer's actual commission schedule.
It requires that you do some coding, by implementing the <a href='https://github.com/johanley/end-game/blob/master/src/endgame/security/stock/commission/CustomCommish.java'>CustomCommish</a> class.

<p id='tfsa-room'><pre>tfsa-room {
  initial-room = 19877.98  
  yearly-limit = 6000.00
}</pre>
Optional. Used to calculate the room in your TFSA account (if you have one).
The <em>initial-room</em> is your TFSA room as of the <em>start-date</em> of the simulation.

<p id='accounts'><pre>accounts { 
  # Initial account holdings.
  # In this simulation, you can have only up to 1 account of each account-type.
  # Only the bank account is required. The others are optional.
  bank {
    cash = 10000.00
    small-balance-limit = 4000.00
  }
  rif {
    convert-rsp-to-rif = 2018-05-01
    cash = 0.00
    stock-positions {
      1910 "ABC"
      813 "XYZ"
      952 "XEG"
    }

    }
    stock-book-values {
      33362.34 "XYZ"
      14978.87 "ABC"
    }
  }
}</pre>
The initial positions of your investment accounts and bank account.
If your bank balance falls below the <em> small-balance-limit</em>, then you are charged fees.
The <em>stock-book-values</em> applies only to the <em>nra</em> account (the non-registered account).
The <em>convert-rsp-to-rif</em> date deserves special mention. 
Before this date, the RIF account simply has no minimum annual withdrawal. 
Other than that, it acts the same. 
That means no contributions to the RSP can be made before the conversion date in this simulation.
In other words, RSPs are modeled here in a limited way.
<b>Note the names of the accounts used here: rif, tfsa, and nra (non-registered account).</b> 


<P id='sequential-liquidation'><pre>sequential-liquidation {
  avoid-downturn-years = 2 
  account-sequence = rif,nra,tfsa
  stock-sequence = "xeg,cm,enb"
  sell 6.0% on *-11-26 | 2027-01-01..2034-12-31 
  sell 3.0% on *-11-26 | 2035-01-01.. 
}</pre>
Optional. Describes how to liquidate stock positions, in order to generate cash flow.
The <em>avoid-downturn-years</em> is a way of avoiding liquidations when the price of the stocks are lower.
In the example above, the meaning is <em>if the current price is lower than the prices of the past 2 years, then don't sell</em>.
The two <em>sequence</em> items define the order in which to sell stock, from which account, and then which stock in that account.
The above example sells 6% of the investments on Nov 26, from 2027 to 2034. Later, from 2035 on, 3% is sold.


<P id='annual-tfsa-top-up'><pre>annual-tfsa-top-up {
  account-sequence = rif,nra
  stock-sequence = "enb,cm"
  on *-01-03                
}</pre>
Optional. Topping up your TFSA account by transferring in-kind from other accounts.
This is done every January 3, in the above example.
The two <em>sequence</em> items define the order in which to transfer stock, from which account, and then which stock in that account.

<P id='small-paycheck'><pre>small-paycheck 50.00 on *-15 | 2024-01-01..2026-12-31
small-paycheck 150.00 on *-15 | 2026-01-01..2027-12-31</pre>
Optional. Can appear multiple times. Employment earnings. 
The expectation is that these earnings are modest, since you are retired.
However, that isn't enforced explicitly.
In the above example, the person gets a raise in 2026 from 50.00 to 150.00.
Your paycheck is modeled simplistically, without CPP contributions or EI deductions. 
There's simply a gross amount that is deposited to your bank account, and that is added to the employment income line on your tax return.

<h2 id='examplesnippetstransactions'>Example Snippets - Transactions Block</h2>

<p id='transactions'><pre>transactions {
  # Transactions in your accounts, not yet defined implicitly.
  ...
}</pre>
Transactions against your accounts that aren't specified elsewhere.
Items in the <em>transactions</em> block are different:
<ul>
 <li>they can appear in any order
 <li>they are all optional
 <li>they can appear 0, 1, or N times
</ul>
 

<P id='bank-debit-credit'><pre>bank-debit-credit 925.00 on *-01 # rent on the first of the month</pre>
A debit or credit to your bank account. Spending means debit, a deposit means credit.
This line usually represents regular spending.
The convention used here is that if the amount is a credit, it's a negative amount on this line instead of a positive amount.

<P id='sweep-cash-from'><pre>sweep-cash-from nra on *-01
sweep-cash-from rif  on *-03-01,*-06-01,*-09-01,*-12-01
</pre>
Move the cash from an investment account account to your bank account.
'nra' stands for non-registered account.
The first example executes on the first of every month.
The second example executes quarterly.

<p id='spend-bank-balance-above'><pre>spend-bank-balance-above 5000.00 on *-02-15,*-05-15,*-08-15,*-11-15</pre>
A generic way of spending the cash in your bank account.
Only the amount above the given base amount is spent.
When the money is spent, it simply disappears from the bank account.

<P id='sell-stock'><pre>sell-stock rif 952 shares "ABC" on 2022-06-20
buy-stock rif 952 shares "ABC" on 2022-06-20</pre>
Sell or buy shares in an investment account.
In the example, the ticker symbol is ABC.  

<p id='buy-gic'><pre>buy-gic rif "Home Trust" 7500.00 2.5% 1-year : 2022-06-21</pre>
Purchase a GIC. 
There's no corresponding sell.
In this simulation, the GIC is always held to maturity in the account that purchased it.
Note that the <em>on</em> syntax for the date of execution is not used here. 
Instead, the ":" symbol is used, and you can only specify the date as yyyy-mm-dd.
The purchase of a GIC will, in the background, also trigger two other kinds of transactions: the 
redemption of the GIC, and, for multi-year GICs, the accrual of interest for your tax return. 

<p id='transfer-stock-in'><pre>transfer-stock-in tfsa 100 shares "ABC" on 2027-05-15 
transfer-stock-out rif 1500.00 "ABC" on 2027-05-15</pre>
Transfer stock into or out of an account.
You can specify either the number of shares, or a principal amount.

<P id='move-stock'><pre>move-stock from rif to tfsa 100 shares "ABC" on 2027-05-15
move-stock from rif to tfsa 7500.00 "ABC" on 2027-05-15</pre>
Move stock in kind from one account to another. 
You can specify either the number of shares, or a principal amount.

<P id='annuity-payment'><pre>annuity-payment 2000.00 on *-25 | 2027-05-25..</pre>
An annuity regularly pays money into your bank account.
The above example pays on the 25th of every month, starting on 2027-05-25 and paying until the end of the simulation.

<P id='stock-split'><pre>stock-split 2-to-1 "ABC" on 2027-05-12</pre>
<span  style='padding-bottom:75em'>Perform a stock split. 
Can be 2-to-1, 3-to-1, 4-to-1, and so on.
The price of the stock is reduced accordingly, and stock positions are increased accordingly.
Any historical stock data is also adjusted.
Performing an occasional stock split can help in the precision of the simulation. 
Often, you will be liquidating a certain percentage.
That translates eventually into a number of shares.
If the share price has grown large over time, there's less granularity in the calculated amounts.</span>
