<h2>End Game: Personal finance simulator for retired Canadians</h2>

<P>The source code is <a href='https://github.com/johanley/end-game'>here</a>.
 
<h2>Overview</h2>
The main purpose of this project is to: 
<ul> 
 <li>help you explore different financial retirement scenarios  
 <li>help you find a better retirement plan
</ul>

<P>This tool is focused almost entirely on the retirement phase of life (spending), not the working phase of life (saving).

<P>The level of detail is higher than you typically see in such tools.
The tool actually goes through every single day of your retirement, and applies transactions to your accounts.
It also calculates a basic tax return at the end of every year.

<P>The level of detail will not reflect your actual reality 100%, but it will get you closer to reality than most other tools.
It's a trade off: in a perfect world, matching reality 100% is of course desirable; but to implement in software all possible cases
for all possible conditions is not practical. So, this tool tries to reach a compromise, and tries to reflect 
reality "to reasonable degree", but not with 100% accuracy. 

<P>
Every retirement financial plan should be supported by a robust simulation showing you the numbers.
Personal finance is quite complex.
There are many moving parts, and the end result of how those parts all work together in your particular situation 
can be found only with a simulator. You can't do these calculations in your head, and  
you shouldn't rely entirely on "rules of thumb", because such rules usually have exceptions.

<P>This tool has:
<ul>
 <li>helped me "find" thousands in additional dollars in cash flow
 <li>increased my level of confidence in my financial plan
 <li>helped me answer many different questions
</ul>

<h2>Limitations</h2>
I'm going to tell you the defects of this tool up front, because I don't want to waste your time.

This tool currently reflects the financial situation of its author, and is limited in scope:
<ul>
 <li>there's no logic for spouses
 <li>the set of supported securities is small: cash, stocks, and GICs. (A glaring omission is ETFs, which will likely be addressed soon.)
 <li>it supports RSP/RIF, TFSA, non-registered accounts, and simple bank accounts, but no other types of accounts (I'll likely add LIRA/LIF in the near future).
</ul>

In spite of these limitations, you may find it useful to examine the outputs and design of this code.

<h2>Input and Output</h2>

The input and output of this tool are simple text files.
The input file is called a <em>scenario</emscenario>em> file. 
It details your current holdings in various accounts, transactions in the accounts, OAS, CPP, GIS, your federal and 
provincial tax returns, and so on.
