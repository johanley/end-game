<h2>End Game - personal finance simulator for retired Canadians</h2>

<P>The source code is <a href='https://github.com/johanley/end-game'>here</a>.

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
This is a guide for running the code in the Eclipse tool.

<h3>Step 1 - Folders and Source Code</h3>
<br>First, create a <b>workspace</b> folder on your machine.

<P>When you launch Eclipse, you need to point to a workspace folder.
A workspace folder contains project folders.
Each project folder contains the source code for a project.

<P>These instructions will use a workspace named: 
<pre>C:\myworkspace\</pre>  

<P>An example setup:
<pre>
C:\myworkspace\            [the workspace folder]
  C:\myworkspace\end-game  [the project folder for end-game]
    ./settings
    docs            
    input             
    lib               [the various files and folders in the end-game project]
    scenario
    src
    .classpath
    .gitignore
    .project
    LICENSE.txt
    README.md
</pre>

<P>Your setup will be similar, except you can replace <em>C:\myworkspace\</em> with something else, if you wish.

<P>Next, you need to put the source code into the above folder structure:
<ul> 
 <li>go to the <a href='https://github.com/johanley/end-game'>github repository</a> 
 <li>click on the <em>Code</em> button
 <li>click on <em>Download ZIP</em>
 <li>copy the <em>end-game-master.zip</em> file to your workspace folder
 <li>unzip the file
 <li>change the name of the new folder from <em>end-game-master</em> to <em>end-game</em>
 <li>your folders should now follow the pattern shown above!
</ul>

<h3>Step 2 - Install and Run Eclipse</h3>
Install and run Eclipse, following these steps: 
<P><a href='https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/'>Download</a> the Eclipse installer.
 
<P>Run the installer, and select <em>Eclipse IDE for Java Developers</em>: 
<P><img src='install-01.png'>

<P>Install Eclipse to a convenient location on your computer:
<P><img src='install-02.png'>

<P>Launch Eclipse, and point it to the workspace directory you created earlier:
<P><img src='install-03.png'>

<p>The first time you launch Eclipse, it will show you a welcome screen. Close the welcome screen:
<P><img src='install-04.png'>
 
<P>Now you will see the main Eclipse window:
<P><img src='install-05.png'>


<h3>Step 3 - Import the end-game Project into Eclipse</h3>
Now that you have Eclipse running, it's time to point it to the <em>end-game</em> project and its source code.

<P>Click on <em>Import Projects</em>. Or, from the menu, select <em>File -> Import...</em>

<P>Choose <em>General -> Existing Projects into Workspace</em>:
<P><img src='install-06.png'>
 
<P>Point to the end-game project folder:
<P><img src='install-07.png'>

<P>The result should look like this: 
<P><img src='install-08.png'> 


<h3>Step 4 - Run an Example Scenario</h3>
On the left, open the <em>src</em> folder, and then the <em>endgame</em> folder.
Double click on the <em>RunSimulation</em> file (this is called a class in Java): 
<P><img src='install-09.png'>
 
<P>Before you run it, you need to ensure that RunSimulation is pointed to the desired scenario file.
Look for this line:
<pre>RunSimulation runner = new RunSimulation("C:\\myworkspace\\end-game\\scenario\\01.1\\01.1-no-savings-CPP-0.ini");</pre>

<P>In Java code, comments are preceded by // characters. When you place // at the start of a line of code, that means
you, in effect, turn it off and prevent it from executing.

<P>In the menu, select <em>Run -> Run As... -> Java application</em>.

<h3>Step 5 - Create your own Scenario</h3>
Now you are ready to experiment with your own scenarios.
<ul>
 <li>create your own scenario file. You can place the scenario anywhere you want. 
 Many will find it convenient to follow the existing pattern under the <em>scenario</em> folder in the project.
 You'll likely want to explore multiple scenarios, so you might create multiple folders under <em>scenario</em>, one folder 
 for each new scenario. 
 <li>set the project-root location in the scenario file
 <li>execute the <em>RunSimulation</em> class. 
 You need to tell it the file location of your scenario file.
 The simplest way is to hard-code it in the <em>RunSimulation</em> class itself. 
</ul>


<h3>Step 6 (Optional) - Install the JavaCC plugin</h3>
You can skip this if you wish. The JavaCC tool lets you change the syntax of the scenario file.
You won't likely need to do that. 

<P>To install the JavaCC plugin into Eclipse
<ul>
 <li>from the menu, select Help -> Eclipse Marketplace
 <li>in the Find box, enter "javacc" and hit Enter
 <li>click the <em>Install</em> button for the JavaCC plugin
</ul>
