/** 
 A simple life annuity purchased with funds from a pension or RIF, with a fixed payout.
 There's no correction for inflation in this implementation.
 
 <P>Annuities are not held in an investment account. 
 They are a separate entity.
 They are usually purchased from an insurance company.
 
 <P>Payments from this annuity are taxable income, and contribute to the pension-amount line on your tax return.
 As I understand it, pensions for Canadian federal government employees are usually of this form.
 
 <P>Some annuities have payments with other tax components, interest and return-of-capital. 
 Those aren't implemented here.
